# AI-AMTMan
AI Aircraft Maintenance Task Manager (AI-AMTMan). Aircraft Maintenance is a documentation intensive and time consuming task that requires lots of engineer time. AI-AMTMan automates this problem through AI.

## General Project Description

- Bring Service Manuals in a database or manage the access (from third party companies)
- Create a chat where you provide the basic info for the general task (aircraft type, service to execute etc.)
- Obtain all the parent-child task to be sent to print or eDocumented for the technicians/inspectors executing the tasks

A significant and valuable time of the technicians/engineers time in a MRO operation is wasted searching and picking the right information for the maintenance/repair tasks in a complex Jet Aircraft. If an AI prompted and driven query could do this automatically it could save a significan amount of time for the technicians even if it is not 100% accurate and the repair shop could speed the delivery of serviced/repaired aircraft up to 30-50%.

## What problem does it solve?

When a complex jet aircraft needs service or repair, the technicians should have the proper materials to work on the aircraft but also the proper service/repair manual information. There are industry standards for manual information classification but the reality is that every manufacturer has its own philosophy about their manuals logic and structure. That is why the searching for the proper tasks before even starting working on the aircraft, usually requires the flexibility of a human agent. This labor is time consuming because the information for a service and even for a repair could be in many different parts of the manual or even in a different manual (e.g. airplane or engine, etc.). So it is a problem when the time for this search for all the proper documents is comparable to the time that the service or repair is of the same order of magnitude. The proposed solution here, is to exploit the capabilities of an AI agent so that the production of the required documents is completed in minimal time. The proposed scheme is not limited by a simple initial general query (though that would be ideal in some cases) but could consist in a couple of iterations after the initial material is generated. The latter would be probably common since some tasks will require a search in semantically distant manuals.
